## 🎭 What Even Is This?

Picture this: **98 Bill Wurtz music videos** (including his legendary history videos), a **permanent shuffle button that won't quit**, and an interface made **entirely of emojis**. No words. No text. Just pure, unfiltered emoji communication.

It's like someone took a radio, threw it into a kaleidoscope, added some Bill Wurtz magic, and said "yeah, this is fine." 

**Spoiler alert:** It's more than fine. It's *chef's kiss* 👨‍🍳💋

## ✨ The Experience

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🎬 **Fullscreen Immersion**
Your entire screen becomes the video. No distractions. No escape. Just you, Bill Wurtz, and the void.

### 🔀 **Eternal Shuffle**
The shuffle button? It's not a button. It's a lifestyle. It's always on. You can't turn it off. Don't even try.

### 💾 **Memory Lane**
Your listening history? Saved. Your loved songs? Remembered. Your vibe? Preserved across the space-time continuum (aka localStorage).

</td>
<td width="50%">

### ❤️ **Love Language**
Hit that love button and watch your favorite songs appear **3x more often**. Toast notification confirms your choice. Loved songs show [❤️] with square brackets in the browser tab title, updating instantly.

### ⌨️ **Keyboard Wizard**
Too cool for clicking? We got you. Space, arrows, V, C, X. You're basically a DJ now.

### 👻 **Ghost Controls**
Controls appear when you need them, vanish when you don't. They're like ninjas, but for UI.

### 🍞 **Toast Notifications**
Love or unlove a song? Get instant emoji feedback (❤️ / 💔) that appears and fades away gracefully.

### ⚠️ **Penalty Mode**
Skip too many songs too fast? The player fights back. Skip 5 songs in under 10 seconds each, and you're locked out of the next button for 3 songs. Patience is a virtue.

## 📝 Notes for Judges

### 🎯 Challenge Interpretation

**"Emoji-only UI"** - We took this literally. Every single interactive element, button, label, notification, and title is an emoji. Even the toast notifications that appear when you love/unlove a song are pure emoji (❤️ / 💔). The browser tab title uses emojis for everything, including the [❤️] loved indicator.

**"Get weird"** - We added a penalty mode. Skip too many songs too fast (5 skips under 10 seconds each), and the player locks you out of the next button for 3 songs. The countdown shows as emoji numbers (1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣). It's like the player is saying "no, you need to actually listen to Bill Wurtz."

### 🎨 Design Decisions

**Why Bill Wurtz?** His music is already weird, colorful, and chaotic. Translating his song titles to emojis felt natural. Plus, we included his legendary history videos (history of the entire world, i guess / history of japan).

**Why penalty mode?** To discourage mindless skipping and encourage actual listening. It's a music player with opinions.

**Why weighted shuffle?** Loved songs appear 3x more often because if you love something, you should hear it more. Simple.

**Why localStorage?** Your listening history, loved songs, and even your penalty status persist across sessions. The player remembers your relationship with it.

### 🔍 Things to Try

1. **Love a song** (V key or ❤️ button) - Watch the browser tab title update instantly with [❤️]
2. **Skip rapidly** - Try to skip 5 songs in under 10 seconds each. The penalty mode will activate.
3. **Check the history** - Recent plays sidebar (📜 button or C key) shows your listening journey
4. **Keyboard shortcuts** - Space, Arrows, V, M, C, X - full keyboard control
5. **Auto-hide controls** - Let the video play for 5 seconds, controls fade away
6. **Page title** - Watch it change with each song, showing [❤️] for loved tracks

### 🛠️ Technical Highlights

- **No build process** - Vanilla JS + Alpine.js from CDN
- **16.9MB container** - Chainguard nginx, minimal and secure
- **98 videos** - All pre-fetched, no API keys needed
- **localStorage** - Plays, loves, and skip tracking all persisted
- **Responsive** - Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Emoji-only** - Not a single word in the UI (we counted)

### 🎵 Easter Eggs

- The project name in the tab (🎵📻🎨) is itself emoji-only
- Toast notifications slide in from the top with a gradient background
- The penalty countdown pulses with a red glow
- Currently playing song in history has a pulsing ▶️ indicator
- Loved songs in the shuffle queue appear 3x more often (weighted algorithm)
